# PyTorchTracking
- A light frame for tracking and detection. We will implement some typical algorithms in this repository.
- Based on PyTorch 1.x
## train
- dataset: the data for training your model
- data: the sampler and the handler of data for training
- model: the network for your training
-- backbone: the extracter for deep features
-- network: the network for your model
- trainer: the trainer for your model
-utils: the extra dependencies
train.py: perform training
